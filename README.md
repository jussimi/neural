# A zero-dependency neural network implementation

Contains an example of training a XOR-problem and MNIST.
Mnist dataset (csv) needs to be loaded into the root of the project from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
  - not included in repo, since it is huge.

Also contains rough implementations for these optimizers:
  - gradient descent
  - momentum
  - nesterov momentum
  - AdaGrad
  - AdaDelta
  - RMSProp
  - Adam
